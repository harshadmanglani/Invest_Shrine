<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img align="center" src="https://github.com/harshadmanglani/Assets/raw/master/route.jpeg" height="640" width="303">

* This app lets entrepreneurs sign up, create their individual profiles and create a venture profile (startup/SME) which will show up on the portfolio list for every other investor to see.
Investor profiles are visible to entrepreneurs to search and "beep" once they have signed up.

* Beeps are analogous to the "poke" functionality on facebook, wherein entrepreneurs can beep investors to view their venture profiles and get in touch if interested.

* Investors can save venture profiles to view later.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

During the course of building this project, attempts were made to follow a typical software development life-cycle, with specific focus on Product Management tasks.

Initially, the wireframes and the user-flows looked something like this:
| Wireframe | User flow |
| --- | --- |
| <img src="https://github.com/harshadmanglani/Assets/raw/master/inv-home-init.jpeg" height="320" width="180"> | <img src="https://github.com/harshadmanglani/Assets/raw/master/user-flow.jpeg" height="320" width="180"> |

These wireframes were ambiguous, and led to confusion during actual code-writing, as a lot of time was taken up in deciding how different visual elemens should look.

Over time, they improved. And due to these improvements, the app was much easier to code.
